## Hello! 
My name is Anoshka. I'm a software developer, with experience as a python programmer in the  aniamtion industry. I recently received a scholarship to comlete my Diploma in Software Engineering, and am currently building a social media app for pet owners (Check it out here - https://github.com/Anoshka/pawdl_client). I'm looking to work as a Backend Developer, and am open to collaborating on new projects.
